            <li> 1. My name is Yina, and I'm a sophomore majoring in communication design and psychology. </li>
            <li> 2. Most of my background is in traditional drawing and painting, but since my freshman year, I have been exploring more digital tools, and I'm taking this class because I'm interested in becoming a UI/UX designer</li>
            <li> 3. I don't have much experience in HTML or CSS.</li>
            <li> 4. I hope to learn best practices/techniques when it comes to coding/designing for the web</li>
            <li> 5. I think designing for a screen will require a much more dynamic mindset.</li>
            <li> 6. https://garoaskincare.com/ I think this website demonstrates effective design in that it has a consistent system with tasteful ornamentation.</li>

            <li> 8. https://spotify.design/ I believe Spotify Design works well because it not only exemplifies the kind of work a spotify designer might be doing, and also keeps the viewer invested in the content via bright colors and animation.</li>
