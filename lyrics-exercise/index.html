        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>Loser</p>
        <p>Ah, ah</p>

        <br> 

        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
        <p>You left without saying goodbye (fuck, fuck, fuck)</p>
        <p>Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry</p>
        <p>I ball a fist and die inside</p>
        <p>I wish I didn't, but regrettably, I entirely understand why you did it</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Pre-Chorus 1</h3>
        <p>Take one step forward and two jumps back</p>
        <p>One hand on the gate of this cul-de-sac</p>
        <p>Some cursed part of me wants to be cornered</p>
        <p>Right into it even if we crack</p>
        <p>You left early and you arrived too late</p>
        <p>Just right in time to be a huge mistake</p>
        <p>So I wish you well, and I wish you far away</p>
        <p>This was never real, I'll say it 'til I believe it</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Chorus 1</h3>
        <p>I wish I never met you</p>
        <p>You are the worst thing that I'm still</p>
        <p>Keeping tabs on for some stupid reason</p>
        <p>You were just being nice</p>
        <p>Now I fully believe you're out there somewhere also</p>
        <p>Keeping tabs on how I might be feeling</p>

        <br> 

        <h3>Post-Chorus 1</h3>
        <p>For some stupid reason</p>
        <p>I keep on believing</p>
        <p>You care and you're reeling too</p>
        <p>I don't even know you</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        <p>Drowning in my own</p>
        <p>Sad, imagined fantasy of who you could be</p>
        <p>The reality is you</p>
        <p>Unironically love personality tests</p>
        <p>All of the data's weak, half-amusing at best</p>
        <p>But it could never work 'cause I'm an Enneatype 4 Aquarius</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Pre-Chorus 2</h3>
        <p>You say the wrong thing every time you talk</p>
        <p>The red flags wave, the alarms sound off</p>
        <p>I'm so glad our paths didn't cross</p>
        <p>I'm so glad, I'll say it 'til I believe it</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Chorus 2</h3>
        <p>I wish I never met you</p>
        <p>You are the worst thing that I'm still</p>
        <p>Keeping tabs on for some stupid reason</p>
        <p>You're the same with everyone</p>
        <p>I'm not special, no, you're not out there just</p>
        <p>Keeping tabs on how I might be feeling</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Post-Chorus 2</h3>
        <p>That's all just imagined</p>
        <p>I keep on believing</p>
        <p>You care and you miss me too</p>
        <p>I need to get over you</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Outro</h3>
        <p>Oh, oh</p>
        <p>I need to get over you</p>
