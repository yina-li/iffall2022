        <h4>*INTRODUCTION*</h4>
        <p id="read-more">Women in computing were among the first programmers in the early 20th century, and contributed substantially to the industry. As technology and practices altered, the role of women as programmers has changed, and the recorded history of the field has downplayed their achievements.</p>

        <p>Since the 18th century, women have developed scientific computations, including <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole-Reine_Lepaute">Nicole-Reine Lepaute</a>'s prediction of
            Halley's Comet, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Mitchell">Maria Mitchell</a>'s computation of the motion of Venus. The first algorithm intended to be executed by a computer was designed by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> who was a pioneer in the field. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> was the first person to design a
            compiler for a programming language. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, and up to World War II, programming was predominantly done by women; significant examples include the Harvard Computers, codebreaking at Bletchley Park and engineering at NASA.</p>
        <p>After the 1960s, the "soft work" that had been dominated by women evolved into modern software, and the
            importance of women decreased. The gender disparity and the lack of women in computing from the late 20th
            century onward has been examined, but no firm explanations have been established. Nevertheless, many women
            continued to make significant and important contributions to the IT industry, and attempts were made to
            readdress the gender disparity in the industry. In the 21st century, women held leadership roles in multiple
            tech companies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Whitman">Meg Whitman</a>, president and
            chief executive officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer">Marissa Mayer</a>, president and CEO of Yahoo! and
            key spokesperson at Google.
