        Good process photos specifically for Chinese Braised Porkbelly, and the introduction to history behind the dish was helpful for me just in terms of content research.</li>

        Allows you to jump straight to the recipe if you don't want to read the introduction. Margins could be a bit wider for the actual content, but I love the neobrutalist style and useful recipe elements (recipe facts, adding ingredients to shopping list). Also, they implement white space very nicely and have images for every step of the process!</li>

        Their two column layout is really nice, and they make the ingredients list sticky so that you can see them while continuing to scroll through the directions. Not sure how well that would work on mobile, but it looks really nice for desktop users.</li>

        Dynamic use of columns and fixed elements allows for a grounded yet visually engaging home page. A lot of these elements would apply nicely to a recipe page, where there are sections for introduction, ingredients, instructions, and reviews! It's also not overdesigned, so the content remains the focus of the website</li>

        This website is unique in that vertical scrolling results in horizontal movement. I think it was wise to maintain vertical scrolling because that is a convention many of us are used to, but the horizontal movement makes the site more temporal, and I think a timeline like this would make for a great recipe site. </li>

        I'm feeling inspired by a lot of one-page websites as I continue to explore, but I particularly love how this one still offers a fixed navigation menu at the top that can take you to various parts of the page. Moreover, their use of typographic scale and insertion of handdrawn doodles make the site feel fun and homey. I hope to emulate a similar tone in my recipe site.</li>
